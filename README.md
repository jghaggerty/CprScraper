### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./data/payroll_monitor.db
DB_ECHO=false

# Email Notifications
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com

### Agency Configuration

The system uses `config/agencies.yaml` to define which agencies and forms to monitor. The configuration includes:

- Federal agencies (Department of Labor, etc.)
- All 50 state agencies
- Form details (URLs, check frequencies, contact information)
- Monitoring settings
- Notification preferences

Example configuration structure:
```yaml
federal:
  department_of_labor:
    name: "U.S. Department of Labor"
    base_url: "https://www.dol.gov"
    forms:
      - name: "WH-347"
        title: "Statement of Compliance for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction Projects"
        url: "https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/legacy/files/wh347.pdf"
        check_frequency: "daily"

states:
  california:
    name: "California Department of Industrial Relations"
    abbreviation: "CA"
    forms:
      - name: "A1-131"
        title: "California Certified Payroll Report"
        check_frequency: "daily"
```

## üìä Dashboard Features

The web dashboard provides:

### Overview Statistics
- Total agencies and forms monitored
