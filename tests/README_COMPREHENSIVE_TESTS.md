2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Clear test names that explain what is being tested
3. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests with clear sections
4. **Mock External Dependencies**: Don't rely on external services
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Include boundary conditions and error scenarios
6. **Keep Tests Fast**: Individual tests should complete quickly

### Maintaining Tests
1. **Update Tests with Code Changes**: Keep tests in sync with implementation
2. **Review Test Coverage**: Regularly check coverage reports
3. **Refactor Test Code**: Keep test code clean and maintainable
4. **Document Test Data**: Explain test data and scenarios
5. **Monitor Test Performance**: Track test execution times
