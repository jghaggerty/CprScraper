# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Certified Payroll Compliance Monitor

## Introduction/Overview

The AI-Powered Certified Payroll Compliance Monitor is an automated system designed to eliminate the manual burden of monitoring government websites and email notifications for changes to certified payroll reporting requirements, forms, and templates across all 50 states and federal U.S. government agencies. The system will automatically detect, analyze, and alert Product Managers and Business Analysts about relevant changes to forms such as WH-347 (federal), CA A-1-131, and similar compliance documents.

**Problem Statement:** Currently, compliance teams must manually review numerous government websites and subscribe to various email notifications to stay current with regulatory changes, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and often results in missed updates.

**Goal:** Automate the detection and notification of certified payroll compliance changes to ensure the company and its clients remain compliant with government-mandated requirements.

## Goals

1. **Automate Change Detection:** Eliminate manual monitoring of government websites and email notifications
2. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Monitor all 50 states plus federal agencies for certified payroll compliance changes
3. **Timely Notifications:** Provide alerts within 24 hours of detected changes
4. **Reduce Compliance Risk:** Ensure no regulatory changes are missed
5. **Scalable Architecture:** Support future expansion to sub-state entities (counties, cities)
6. **User-Friendly Interface:** Provide clear, actionable alerts for Product Managers and Business Analysts

## User Stories

1. **As a Product Manager**, I want to receive automated alerts when certified payroll form requirements change so that I can prioritize product updates and inform stakeholders.

2. **As a Business Analyst**, I want to see a summary of all recent compliance changes across states so that I can assess the impact on our business processes and client requirements.

3. **As a Product Manager**, I want to filter compliance alerts by state, form type, or change severity so that I can focus on the most relevant updates for my responsibilities.

4. **As a Business Analyst**, I want to access historical compliance change data so that I can track trends and prepare for future regulatory updates.

5. **As a Product Manager**, I want to receive consolidated weekly reports of all compliance changes so that I can plan product roadmap adjustments efficiently.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Automated Web Monitoring:** The system must automatically scan government websites daily for changes to certified payroll forms and requirements.

2. **Change Detection Engine:** The system must detect modifications to form templates, submission requirements, deadlines, and regulatory language.

3. **Alert System:** The system must send email notifications to designated Product Managers and Business Analysts when changes are detected.

4. **Dashboard Interface:** The system must provide a web-based dashboard showing recent changes, pending alerts, and compliance status.

5. **State/Federal Coverage:** The system must monitor all 50 states plus federal agencies for certified payroll compliance changes.

6. **Form Type Tracking:** The system must specifically track changes to forms like WH-347, CA A-1-131, and similar certified payroll documents.

7. **Change Classification:** The system must categorize changes by severity (critical, important, informational) and type (form update, deadline change, requirement modification).

8. **Historical Data Storage:** The system must maintain a searchable database of all detected changes for trend analysis.

9. **Filtering and Search:** The system must allow users to filter alerts by state, form type, date range, and change severity.

10. **Weekly Summary Reports:** The system must generate and distribute consolidated weekly reports of all compliance changes.

11. **Export Functionality:** The system must allow users to export change data in common formats (PDF, CSV, Excel).

12. **User Management:** The system must support user roles and permissions for Product Managers and Business Analysts.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Form Auto-Completion:** The system will not automatically fill out or submit compliance forms.
2. **Legal Interpretation:** The system will not provide legal advice or interpret regulatory requirements.
3. **Client Portal:** The system will not include a client-facing interface in the initial release.
4. **Integration with Payroll Systems:** The system will not integrate with existing payroll or HR systems.
5. **Sub-state Entity Monitoring:** While the architecture will support it, sub-state entity monitoring is not included in the initial scope.
6. **Real-time Monitoring:** The system will not provide real-time alerts; daily/weekly monitoring is sufficient.
7. **Automated Compliance Actions:** The system will not automatically take actions based on detected changes.

## Design Considerations

1. **Clean, Professional Interface:** The dashboard should have a clean, professional appearance suitable for business users.
2. **Mobile Responsive:** The interface should be accessible on mobile devices for on-the-go monitoring.
3. **Intuitive Navigation:** Users should be able to quickly find relevant information and filter results.
4. **Clear Alert Design:** Notifications should clearly indicate the change type, affected state/agency, and urgency level.
5. **Consistent Branding:** The interface should align with the company's visual identity and design standards.

## Technical Considerations

1. **Scalable Architecture:** The system should be designed to easily add new states, agencies, and form types.
2. **Robust Web Scraping:** Implement resilient web scraping that can handle government website changes and downtime.
3. **Data Validation:** Include mechanisms to validate detected changes and reduce false positives.
4. **API-First Design:** Design the system with APIs to support future integrations and expansions.
5. **Security Compliance:** Ensure the system meets security requirements for handling sensitive compliance data.
6. **Backup and Recovery:** Implement robust backup and recovery procedures for compliance data.
7. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize for handling large volumes of government website data efficiently.

## Success Metrics

1. **Detection Accuracy:** Achieve 95% accuracy in detecting relevant compliance changes with less than 5% false positives.
2. **Coverage Completeness:** Monitor 100% of target states and federal agencies within 30 days of launch.
