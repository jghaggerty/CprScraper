## Technical Implementation Details

### Configuration Structure

```yaml
federal:
  department_of_labor:
    name: "U.S. Department of Labor"
    base_url: "https://www.dol.gov"
    forms:
      - name: "WH-347"
        title: "Statement of Compliance for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction Projects"
        check_frequency: "daily"

states:
  alabama:
    name: "Alabama Department of Labor"
    abbreviation: "AL"
    base_url: "https://www.labor.alabama.gov"
    forms:
      - name: "AL-PW-001"
        title: "Alabama Certified Payroll Report"
        check_frequency: "weekly"
```

### Coverage Validation Logic

```python
def _validate_comprehensive_coverage(self) -> None:
    # Check federal agencies
    federal_agencies = self.config.get('federal', {})
    if not federal_agencies:
        raise ValueError("No federal agencies configured")
    
    # Check state agencies
    state_agencies = self.config.get('states', {})
    if len(state_agencies) != 50:
        raise ValueError(f"Expected 50 states, found {len(state_agencies)}")
    
    # Validate all required states are present
    required_states = {'alabama', 'alaska', 'arizona', ...}  # All 50 states
    configured_states = set(state_agencies.keys())
    missing_states = required_states - configured_states
    
    if missing_states:
        raise ValueError(f"Missing states: {missing_states}")
```

### Batch Optimization

```python
def get_optimized_monitoring_batches(self, 
                                   max_concurrent_agencies: int = 10,
                                   max_concurrent_forms: int = 25) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    # Group forms by frequency for optimal scheduling
    frequency_groups = {
        "daily": [],    # High priority, smaller batches
        "weekly": [],   # Medium priority, standard batches
        "monthly": []   # Low priority, larger batches
    }
    
    # Create optimized batches with estimated processing times
    batches = []
    for frequency, forms in frequency_groups.items():
        batch_size = max_concurrent_forms // 2 if frequency == "daily" else max_concurrent_forms
        for i in range(0, len(forms), batch_size):
            batch = forms[i:i + batch_size]
            batches.append({
                "batch_id": f"{frequency}_{len(batches) + 1}",
                "frequency": frequency,
                "priority": "high" if frequency == "daily" else "medium",
                "forms": batch,
                "estimated_duration_minutes": len(batch) * 2 if frequency == "daily" else len(batch) * 1.5
            })
```
