#### ✅ 1.3 Add change classification by severity (critical, important, informational) and type
- **File**: `src/analysis/change_classifier.py`
- **Tests**: `src/analysis/change_classifier.test.py`
- **Description**: Created robust change classification system with severity levels (critical, important, informational, cosmetic) and detailed change types. Includes rule-based classification, AI enhancement, confidence scoring, and compliance impact assessment.

#### ✅ 1.4 Integrate AI analysis service for semantic change detection and false positive reduction
- **File**: `src/analysis/enhanced_analysis_service.py`
- **Tests**: `tests/test_enhanced_analysis_service.py`
- **Description**: Created enhanced analysis service that extends the base AnalysisService with sophisticated false positive detection, semantic change analysis, and content relevance validation. Key features include:

**Enhanced Features:**
- **False Positive Detection**: Multi-stage detection for whitespace-only, formatting-only, dynamic content, and navigation changes
- **Semantic Change Detection**: Pattern-based analysis for critical, structural, and cosmetic changes in compliance documents
- **Content Relevance Validation**: Ensures detected changes are relevant to certified payroll compliance
- **Historical Analysis Tracking**: Maintains analysis history for pattern recognition and performance optimization
- **Adaptive Confidence Thresholds**: Dynamic confidence scoring based on multiple factors

**Integration:**
- Updated `src/monitors/ai_enhanced_monitor.py` to use the enhanced analysis service
- Added fallback to standard analysis service if enhanced service fails
- Enhanced serialization and health checking to include new features
- Comprehensive test coverage for all enhanced functionality

**Key Methods:**
- `analyze_document_changes_enhanced()`: Main enhanced analysis method
- `_detect_false_positives()`: Multi-pattern false positive detection
- `_detect_semantic_changes()`: Compliance-specific change analysis
- `_validate_content_relevance()`: Content relevance validation
- `get_enhanced_service_stats()`: Enhanced statistics and metrics
